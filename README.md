## About ZapFile.ai

ZapFile.ai was created to make large-file sharing effortless. Instead of uploading data to a server, the sender and receiver connect to each other directly through a secure WebRTC channel.  
This means:

- No storage on our side  
- No history saved  
- No file size restrictions  
- The fastest speed your connection can support  

You share, and the other device receives — that’s it.

## Why ZapFile.ai Exists

Many file-sharing tools upload your data to cloud storage before delivering it.  
ZapFile.ai takes the opposite approach: **your data never leaves your device until it reaches the person you're sending it to**.

This makes it ideal for:

- Private one-time file transfers  
- Large videos  
- Rapid local transfers (same Wi-Fi)  
- Sharing without trust issues or accounts
